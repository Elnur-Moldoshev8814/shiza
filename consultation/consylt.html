                                    Consultation psychology is a broad term that loosely defined, speaks of any expert, psychological service provided to a government agency, organization, or business entity. Applied in real life, consultation psychology can be seen everywhere and in use for seemingly countless purposes. For a better look at some of today’s most common uses of this particular field in psychology, we take a quick glance at five examples.

                                    Today’s human resources departments are tasked with using every resource available in the goal of maintaining the perfect employee workforce. Knowing how and in which direction to help its employees grow is an important strategy. Expert psychological services are subsequently needed in order to achieve clear objectives in these matters. Employee incentives, repercussions, training goals, and training methodology are all fair examples of covered topics.

                                    Knowing how consumers feel and react to events is a hugely important objective in most companies. This can govern all aspects of business, from branding identity to advertising methods used. In order to be fully aware and keen in the decisions of such matters, lots of analytical psychology must be tapped. Culture, trends, sociological concepts, and many other concepts govern overall public sentiment. The smart business will use consulting psychology to tune in to all of this.

                                    Similar to consumer sentiment consultation, pre-development market research is all about public opinion. Before developing and producing a product, it is important for a company to know whether or not the consumer market will receive it well. As such, the company is best served by knowing specific desires and turn-offs of specific consumer markets. Age, sex, race, geographic location, and religion all dictate specific slices of consumer market opinions that companies must understand and adapt to.
