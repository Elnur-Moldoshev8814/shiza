                            Self development is the process of learning new things and building new skills—skills that help us increase our chances of success, achieving our goals, and manifesting our dreams.

                            When we work on self-development, we get good at the social, emotional, and practical skills that we need so that we can accomplish what we set out to do. So it's easier, and we have more success.

                                If we have a “fixed mindset,” we may shy away from challenges because we do not want to feel embarrassed or humiliated in front of others—who does, right?! But this can be problematic because our fear of making mistakes can lead us to avoid challenges and new experiences—experiences which would help us grow, improve ourselves in important ways, and create the life we desire.
                            </p>
                            <p class="subtitle-16__size">
                                If we have a “growth mindset,” we enjoy challenges, despite the risk, usually because we value learning and growth more than others thinking we know what we’re doing. That's why those with a growth mindset often build new skills more easily because they believe they can and so they really work at it.

                                Everyone can benefit from learning how to think like an entrepreneur, regardless of whether or not we have our own business. Why? Because entrepreneurs have to be innovative, good at planning for a all possible outcomes, and skilled at getting others to buy into their vision or dream, they tend to be adaptable and capable of thriving in all sorts of situations.
                            </p>

By learning some stress-reducing strategies, your body and mind will be more equipped to handle the challenges that will inevitably arise.

                                    Life is hard sometimes. We all experience ups and downs. But we don't all respond to these ups and downs the same way. Some people let the hard times defeat them. Other people who think positive don't take things so hard. That's why developing your positivity reflex is so important. If you can be even a little bit more positive, the bad times don't look so bleak.
